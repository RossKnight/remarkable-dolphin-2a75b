After many years of rarely looking up from a computer screen and developing a bit of RSI I decided to get back to the pool after a 10 year break. Needless to say progress was slow but I loved every session.

Now, 5 years on, I reckon I would give my younger self a good race (if only because of an improved technique).

I have now completed a range of events including Marathons, Triathlons (being an Age Grouper in the European Championships) and a number of distance swims. 

This blog is not about self promotion, it isn't a swim log, nor is it about recording my events, positions and results. Instead it is just a collection of memorable swim experiences and a few tips that I found useful.

*Thank You for reading!*
