After many years of rarely looking up from a computer  screen I decided it was time to consider the impact on my health. As such I decided to get back to the pool and recreate some of swim sessions I undertook in my 20's. Needless to say it was slow progress but I loved every swim. 5 years on I reckon I would give my younger self a good race. 

>A huge part of swimming for me is I love it, and it is so much fun. <cite>Missy Franklin</cite>

I have now completed a range of events from Marathons, Triathlons (including being an Age Grouper in the European Championships) and a number of distance swims.This blog however is not about self promotion, nor about recording my events,
