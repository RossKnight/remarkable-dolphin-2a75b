After many years of rarely looking up from a computer  screen I decided it was time to consider the impact on my health. When I was younger I was very active so decided to get back to the pool and recreate some of the swim sessions I undertook in my 20's.

5 years on it appears I wish it was something I never gave up in the first place.
