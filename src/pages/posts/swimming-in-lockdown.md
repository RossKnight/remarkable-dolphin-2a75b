excerpt: >-
  Lockdown has been no fun. Between juggling home schooling, work and not being able to easily get out for a swim I took matters into my own hands.

Current restrictions are not so bad but due to limited availability and times that don't fit in with work or the family I've opted to switch my pool swimming sessions from local centres to [The Royal Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commonwealth_Pool). Whilst this was somewhat forced up me the change of location has worked out well. I get to swim at times convenient to myself (often 5:30am) and in an Olympic sized pool which is probably better for my Open water swimming.

Before this swimming was restricted to Open Water and due to travelling restrictions at my local reservoir, Gladhouse.

However due a bit of a decorating accident and a subsequent bad back I was reluctant to go when too cold in case I cramped up which limited my time in the water over winter.

In Lockdown when I went from swimming from 5 days a week to 0 I found it hard. Swimming has always been a way I can turn off. Obviously there are no distractions in the water but more that that when I focus on my breathing and technique my brain doesn't wonder (which it does in almost any other situation). I might say more about this in another post but I suppose swimming is my own form of meditation as I am not the type of person that would entertain the more traditional form.

The weather we had in the first lockdown was unbelievable and whilst it was great to be able to sit in the garden with the family (lucky to have a garden I know) it made me yearn even more for the Open Water. As such after a fair amount of research I opted to take a gamble on free standing temporary pool that the kids would love even if it didn't serve the intended purpose. 

With a limited amount of flat space in our garden and an equally limited budget I opted for a Bestway 56629 | Power Steel - Rectangular Outside Ground Swimming Pool, 282 x 196 x 84 cm
